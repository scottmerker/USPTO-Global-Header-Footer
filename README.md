#### About this repository
This project provides a template for the header and footer
for USPTO web sites that helps them to have a uniform look and feel with other USPTO web sites. Its intent is
to help those sites by providing a repository with all code and assets needed. This alleviates the time and effort
to have to build it.
It uses the [USPTO UI Design Library](http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/index.html) for its style guide.
